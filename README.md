# Star Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling project focused on the "Star" dataset. The project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the dataset to uncover insights and patterns.

## Project Overview
The main goals of this project are:
1. Load and preprocess the Star dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
3. Use statistical and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights.

## Files in the Repository
- **main.ipynb**: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- **eda.ipynb**: Additional notebook for more in-depth exploratory analysis.
- **Star.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.

## Key Features
- Column renaming for better readability.
- Data visualization using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
- Statistical modeling with `statsmodels`.
